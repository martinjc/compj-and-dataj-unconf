Is data interesting? Is there a story?


## Multi-lingual Data journalism

How do you 'do' data journalism in an area where you need to cover multiple languages.

Linguistic isolation means that examples of good journalism are few/non-existent. Technical problems aren't the worst problem

Eva has an 800 page training manual (based on Hunter's Inquiry method) - helps to redefine journalism for them.
Some languages of this training manual are available online.

Education - there is a gap that needs to be filled.

Data Journalism handbook - useful primer, but is more a collection of essays than a really useful training manual.
