## Multi-lingual Data journalism

How do you 'do' data journalism in an area where you need to cover multiple languages.

Linguistic isolation means that examples of good journalism are few/non-existent. Technical problems aren't the worst problem.

Eva has an 800 page training manual (based on Hunter's Inquiry method) - helps to redefine journalism for them.
Some languages of this training manual are available online.

Education - there is a gap that needs to be filled.

Survey data can be collected in local language - published in english - is there translation bias?

Data Journalism handbook - useful primer, but is more a collection of essays than a really useful training manual.

David - Balkans has a similar problem - lots of small countries with inter-connected problems.

Sharing of data and creation of networks.

Tools:

* Excel deals with UTF-8 poorly
* Open-Refine has very poor language support
* Google Translate üëé (only good for popular languages)
* Tabula is no good in Burmese
    * They have activated right-to-left support
* OCR is no good for Burmese
    * Digits and Numeric data is much easier and OCR works better
* [Tesseract OCR](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/) can be useful (and support many language)
* TensorFlow as an OCR tool?
* Different calendars can cause issues - what year is it!
    * Also data formats between US and elsewhere
    * ISO date format - YYYY-MM-DD !!! üëç



## Teaching Data Journalism

Teaching scientists: "I pushed the button and it didn't work. I'll push a different button"
Teaching non-scientists: "I pushed the button and it didn't work. It's broken"

Problem solving - how to make students identify problem solving as part of journalism.

Focus on the story and the message - really difficult to get people to focus on this over the tools.
Hypothesis writing as a key part of the data-journalism process - including peer-review of the hypothesis
"What are you counting?", "What are you measuring?" - it's basically a research methods class

No point learning how to use the tools if you can't figure out what the question is...

Computational Thinking as a problem solving process for teaching data-journalism

Examples of gender-bias in data journalism examples/training - IRE manual is all based around baseball



## Open Data in closed societies

Data is unavailable, meetings are changed at random
Very far away from an FOI law

Just presenting the data you do get is very confusing - need to add extra context

Small Media - platform for opening data from closed society
Contacting journalists inside the country and asking them to write stories
Will be open to contributions - leads to verification issues
Collaborating with others to learn about ways of accessing data and relaxing and sharing data
Doing a lot of manual cleaning etc.

[CKAN](https://ckan.org/) - open source software for making open-data portals

One of the problems is visibility - letting people know that tools exist and are around

Need communities for people dealing with open-data in these areas - using a blog to start and build the community.

[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) - could be used to help get people to work on data sets and solve problems.

"Data for Change" - event to bring together tech and data journalists etc.

Trust is a big challenge in closed societies - there is no norm of belonging to and participating in online communities.

There is an assumption 'if you have data, democracy will happen' but of course that isn't the case

[DataKind](http://www.datakind.org/) offer similar help with data and problems that need to be solved for NGOs

Data for Democracy slack group

Demand for "Data that is perfectly true"

Balkans/Eastern Europe - subject to a lot of European FOI/Data laws but are still quite closed - hide data that can reveal issues (corruption etc).

'I can make you look good/fix problems' can be a way of gaining access to data

'A little bit of data journalism can be a dangerous thing' - poor use of the little open data that does exist can result in a closing down of the data - how do you communicate uncertainty within data, and would more nuance help?

You won't solve it with a "we'll build an app for that"
